## Why AI Adoption Is Stuck

“AI tools go further than ChatGPT or Gemini.” Yeah, no kidding. But for most
people, that sentence might as well be lorem ipsum. The deeper issue is that
while the tools have evolved, the way we present them hasn’t. They’re wrapped in
complexity, built for insiders, and feel like alien artifacts to anyone outside
the dev/design/ops trifecta.

You’ve got people using AI every day without realizing it: auto-tagging in
photos, autocomplete in Gmail. But as soon as you hand them a “real” AI tool,
they bounce. Not because they’re dumb, but because the interface demands they
already speak the language. It’s like handing someone a shell script and
wondering why they don’t use Linux.

Right now, most AI products are stuck in what amounts to the command-line era of
AI. Powerful, yes. But the mental load required to start using them is
non-trivial. You need domain knowledge to get value. Which is fine if your users
are engineers or researchers. But if your goal is mass adoption? lol no.

And yet companies keep pushing these tools into orgs, chasing productivity
boosts. Which works, for a while, because the users are specialists or at least
tech-adjacent. But once you hit the edge of that cohort, adoption flatlines. The
tools don’t invite exploration. They gatekeep via jargon, unclear feedback
loops, and zero contextual affordances.

This is where the “AI is a UX problem” take hits hard. We’re not lacking
capability. We’re lacking empathy in the interface. Calling tools like Cursor or
Perplexity “wrappers” misses the point: they reshape the cognitive cost of
interaction. They package raw power into something tractable. Same as how early
computers needed punch cards and then boom: GUI. Mouse. Windows. Mass adoption.

The problem isn’t the model. The problem is you have to understand the model to
use it. The AI itself might be state-of-the-art, but if the product design
treats accessibility as an afterthought, the whole thing collapses outside the
tech echo chamber.

So yeah, AI adoption is stuck, not because it’s not ready, but because it’s
badly dressed. It walks into the room in an obscure academic paper and expects
applause. We need to give it jeans and a t-shirt.

## Why It’s Still a Specialist’s Game

The need for domain knowledge: Non-specialists can’t interact with AI in
meaningful ways without extra effort. The usual domain knowledge is called the
“command-line” phase of AI, it is accessible to specialists, but not ready for
mass adoption. The gap in the market for AI tools designed with simplicity and
accessibility in mind for everyday users.

There is a huge market for this specialists, of course, there's silly amount of
interest from corporations to force their employees to use AI tools to cut back
costs or boost productivity, but what can also be seen is one of the biggest
industries in the world investing greatly in these tools, it doesn't matter if
they requiere domain knowledge because their company and employees are likely
related to the domains around AI.

## Product Design is Trust and Accessibility

Trust isn't just an ethical consideration. Trust starts from silly things like
backlinks on articles or documentation for the tool. One of the best
trust-inducing mechanisms is good accessibility, because with it the product
makes much more users feel seen, thing that psychologically makes them trust the
product more.

Trust also is Trusting that the product will consistently work as expected. Not
only should the user trust that the product's company isn't doing something
wrong with their data, for example, but also that the product will work and
continue working without failure. This is a challenge in deterministic software,
it's become a problem bigger than every with AI-based non-deterministic
software.

## A Product is Still a Product: The MVP Trap

Focusing solely on the MVP can lead to overlooking crucial UX elements that
ensure future success. A bloated MVP filled with features but poor usability can
set the product back, making it harder to iterate effectively, and iterating
should be you're main goal for an MVP.

Building a product that solves a real problem with as little complexity as
possible. Ensuring the right tech stack and solid design principles from the
start can make scaling easier and more efficient in the long run.
