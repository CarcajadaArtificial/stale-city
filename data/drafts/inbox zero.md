Thoughts:

- "Inbox Zero"? What about "Everything Zero"?
- More than chores, "Life Zero". Having a default state that tends to clearness.
- Forgiveness before authoritarianism. Not cleaning my inbox in a perfect daily
  routine, shouldn't be a punishable offense. Same thing with everything else.
- The way of doing things should make it easier to maintain inbox zero, not the
  other way around.
- Having enough control of your inbox to achieve this should bring systematic
  peace. It shouldn't cause uncomfortable feelings to do it. Cleaning has never
  been and will never be an intrinsically negative task, maintaining should be a
  desirable task.
