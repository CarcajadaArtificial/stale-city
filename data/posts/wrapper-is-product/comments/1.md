I feel like the following thought process is a strange one. There has been tons
of "new AI _buzzword_ startups that create the new _buzzword_ tool that
_buzzwords_ this and that." and even tons more of "it's just a _something_
wrapper" responses. The problem is that most of these tools speak so little the
language of the common user that they never truly enter the masses, even the
ones within it's own niche. Who cares if it is a measly "wrapper"? As long as
common people get to be able to understand it, worse than this is a non-wrapper
product that only a few select group of people get it.
