  While my generation boasts adaptability, it lacks the moral flexibility to do
  whatâ€™s necessary for society's benefit.

According to Machiavelli, the ability we humans have to adapt our moral system
to complex situations is what he calls "virtue." It's the strength to fight
uncontrollable circumstances that arise on your leadership path. These
circumstances he calls "fortune."

Politics isn't about meticulous plans or getting what you want, according to
Machiavelli's philosophy; in my opinion, this philosophy can be pulled from
politics and adapted to daily life. It's about dealing with this fortune,
transforming it into victory no matter what it takes.

My generation, while still boasting adaptability, has no virtue. We're so
morally closed off that any opposition is seen as a threat. Virtue is doing
what's necessary for the good of society, even if it goes against your
individual moral system.

That said, I don't mean to imply my generation has the least virtue. At the end
of the day, some members of generations before ours deny society's benefit,
biased by religious moral systems. Still, I think we have a lot of virtue to
harvest in the generational field watered by fortune that we're living in.
