Back in 2017 when I wrote "On Telling Stories", I had Design all over my mind at
the time. I was very serious about the impact good design has on modern life. I
felt like many poor human experiences came from fails in Design practices.
Design englobed every single decision on the production of almost anything in
modern day-to-day-life. Things like traffic, crowded movie theaters, renewing
your passport, retail work, etc where like that because of poor design, which
itself has infinite causes like incompetence, disinterest, impatience, or greed.

This huge space in my mind occupied by Design, there's a certain bias on the
original idea of this article, and on retrospective, it makes it look as if
storytelling was merely a device or dimension of the Design practice. But
really, for me, the art of telling stories is something even more profound than
that, so I had to make an update.
