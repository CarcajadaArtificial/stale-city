What is a story? What does it mean for something to be real? What's the scope of
telling stories? To me, the story is the base of the human perception. Beauty
and despair are both human experiences that happen as a consequence of a story.
Pain, pleasure, curiosity, deep fear, and our _biological urges_, whatever they
might be, seem intrinsic to the "normal-animal" section of our humanity, even if
it has a blurry frontier.

How does your inner speech look like? Mine is almost always conversational, and
I like it so much I try to do it as often as I can. If you'd develop mind
reading abilities and used them on me on an average moment you would likely hear
an imaginary conversation with myself disguised as another person, potentially
anyone.

People who know me know Iâ€™m kind of annoyingly anecdotal when I talk. This
happens because whenever I'm having a conversation, it's likely that it has
already happened some amount of times before, inside my head and with myself. I
don't see this as a goal but as a consequence of my liking of my naturally
conversational inner speech. Even when I do a monologue I feel like it has a
conversational soul. I love it when other get involved during a monologue, I'd
often ask questions during, sometimes rhetorical, other times not. I really like
to make pauses when telling stories, giving a space for people to comment on the
distinct steps of the story. It's not that I would plan the stories ahead of
time before telling them to my friends. I can barely plan out the stories that I
want to tell the world without spiraling into a never-ending pool of
distractions and side-ideas.

Really what happens is that I have this profound trust into how things make me
feel. If something happened recently or if I saw a movie that moved me hugely,
then I would trust that feeling when remembering and retelling it. I wouldn't
think about plot devices, character arcs, motifs, or any kind of structure
beforehand. I firmly believe that a combination of unbiased perspective and an
honest recapitulation of events is what allows you to be sensible to the
impactful stories of day-to-day experiences.

The biggest difference between kids and adults here is that kids can still feel
surprise. And in my opinion, surprise is one of the most powerful emotions if
you want to get and direct attention. Too many people are too deep in their
mental mechanisms to be surprised by anything anymore.

Great stories are everywhere. Whether they get remembered depends on how you
tell them.
