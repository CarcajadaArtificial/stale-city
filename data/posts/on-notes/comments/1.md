this version fuses two older posts into one clean arc. nothing cut, just
stitched together in order. first bit sketches the why of the app: ditching
doc-brain for idea-first. nods to bullet journal + zettelkasten. explains core
features + motives. second bit dives into the how: MVP limits (no styling,
images, collab), then tees up next stepsâ€”mobile, tags, threads, timelines. keeps
the flow from theory to roadmap, so readers get the full drift start to now.
