Me praying:

> Hello? God? It's me. I had that dream again, I cannot seem to take this idea
> out of my head. You know, it's been bugging me for a long time now. I believe
> I have the power to make it, I'm just unsure of my skills and decisions.
> Please help me find confidence in my tools so I can finally do it. Please,
> help me find the way. Amen.

## Introduction

It's not an exaggeration, I've been dreaming of this thing for years now. I was
afraid that when making it I would suddenly hate the foundations with what it
was made. But the more I thought about it I came to realize that there was only
one thing I wanted to control, to build from scratch. It was a UI component
library, things like Material UI or Bootstrap were the ones that made me
nervous.

Now, let's talk about hypothetical situations. Usually, when one thinks about
going back in time, to talk to oneself; one would give a piece of bold advice:
"Start now", "Make mistakes faster", "Don't wait", or something like that. So
far, I wouldn't do that. Even though I see the great value in leanness, that
early mistakes cost less than late mistakes, or that learning now is better than
learning later. But at that time, starting early would've been costly. I'm
thankful that at that time I knew exactly what I wanted and slowly sculpted it.
"What is this dream, then? Too much talk, man." I know, I know, I'm sorry.

## Influences

What is the base of every app for taking notes? A text editor that makes
documents. That's it. That's what Google Docs has in common with Notion,
Obsidian, Notepad, TextEdit, MS Word, etc. It's a tool that creates and edits
text in a document. This is where I differ philosophically, I don't want to
store, edit, and organize documents. I want to do it with individual ideas. No
documents, only ideas.

This removes the distraction of text styles like bold or italic text, headings,
spacing, line heights, font sizes, tables of contents, folders, pages, covers,
etc. Just write the damn idea and let it be.

My inspirations are really clear and direct, the Bullet Journal and the
Zettelkasten method of note-taking. My ideal tool functions just as a Bullet
Journal, it follows its natural steps into the digital realm.

### Bullet Journal

- Notes can be identified by their left marker.
- One idea in one bullet, not writing paragraphs of prose keeps information
  concise.
- You can keep track of the same things as in a bullet journal. (Tasks, events,
  notes, etc)
- Daily, monthly, and yearly views provide different levels of relevant
  information.
- A migration process for unresolved tasks and unconnected notes.

### Zettelkasten Method

- Notes can be marked by a reference, typically this is a place outside the
  notes app, like a URL, date, book, chapter, page, article, video, movie, etc.
  These are typically called "Literature" notes, but this system expands this
  meaning to anything out of the notes app.
- Notes can be promoted to "permanent". This gives them a higher hierarchical
  status than others.
- Having notes expressed as questions is extremely useful for connecting them
  with others.
- It must be trivially easy to find the exact note that is needed.
- Fleeting notes should be easily reviewed later.

## Features

It is a pain to attempt to follow these ideas in any app. The text editing comes
in the way of quickly writing a note. The document system hinders connecting
notes among themselves. And there is no quick way of querying notes in
meaningful ways. Taking advantage of the fact that I'm already tailor-making an
app for myself, why shouldn't I add my deepest opinions on it?

### App features

- It will be self-hosted. Frankly, I don't want anything to do with your data.
  This app is going to be made so a users can easily set it up on the server of
  their liking.
- Free and open-source. I will never charge for this, this is a gift for myself
  and the world.
- The information stored on your notes should be easily downloaded and accessed
  if you decide to quit the app.

This is my dream note-taking app in a nutshell, next time I'll talk in detail
about the pages that make up the site and the different ways of connecting notes
among themselves. Thank you for reading.
