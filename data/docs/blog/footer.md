This site is completely open source. The posts are live and being updated as
naturally as new ones are being posted. I planned it to be like this, comments
help previous readers understand why suddenly they would feel slight changes in
the post's content. Additionally, every change made to the site can be seen in
the
[official GitHub repository](https://github.com/CarcajadaArtificial/stale-city).
